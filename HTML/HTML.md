This folder contains all of the projects that I did for my web development class.<br><br>
This class broke the homework down into challenges, several of which iterated upon one another.<br>
Challenge 1 was a simple webpage that served to display some text and a link.<br>
Challenges 2-7 Then were all iterations upon one another to create a portfolio website. You can view it as it was added upon, or just jump to the final product.<br>
Challenge 8
