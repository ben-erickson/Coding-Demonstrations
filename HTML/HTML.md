This folder contains all of the projects that I did for my web development class.<br><br>
This class broke the homework down into challenges, several of which iterated upon one another.<br>
Challenge 1 was a simple webpage that served to display some text and a link.<br>
Challenges 2-7 Then were all iterations upon one another to create a portfolio website. You can view it as it was added upon, or just jump to the final product.<br>
Challenge 9 was a page that queried the NASA API to display photos taken by the Curiosity Rover. I had a lot of difficulty with it, so it doesn't work perfectly, but it does dispplay pictures.<br>
ToDoList was a project that is hidden within the portfolio website, but I wanted to show it off on its own. It is a simple to do list program.
