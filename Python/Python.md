This folder houses all of my Python projects that I did on my own and for my Python coding class.<br>
Python was amon the first languages that I taught myself, and my class served as an intro to programming course, so many of these are more simplistic.<br>
Some highlights are: Dad's Packing App, a little program I made for my dad when he was packing to produce a packing list for him.<br>
RandomWriteRead, which writes and reads random numbers from a file.<br>
RPS was my final project for the class, and is an interactive game of rock paper scissors that the user can play with the program.
