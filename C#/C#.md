This folder contains all my C# projects dthat I did for my programming course.

These projects range from very simple demonstrations of C# --> "Csharp Basics", "Dog", "Pets", "URLEncoder".
To simple database lookups with LINQ --> "Crime Data Analyzer", "LINQ Practice"
As well as some slightly more complex projects --> "Music Playlist Analyzer"
